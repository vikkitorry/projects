Hey there!

My name is Victoria, and I'm a junior frontend developer.
Let me introduce myself: I am from Krasnoyarsk, Russia, but approximately half in year ago i relocated to Hanoi Vietnam.

I have two higher education, the first one is an architect and second is an air traffic controller (these are people who provide safety in the airspace and manage aircraft in their area of responsibility).  And recently I'm trying to get the third by attending the RSSchool frontend course.

RSSchool isnâ€™t my first step in IT, about 2 years ago I have passed a small python course but circumstances forced me to postpone my entry into the IT world so I shelved this idea till 2022.
In that year i understood that i want to learn JS instead of continue python.  I can't say first steps come naturally for me but down the line through RSSchool course I cope with differrent problems and  fill some knowledge gaps.

According to task I have to tell some information about my last project, so now we will be discussed Minesweeper. Oh, isuppose i played enough this game for the rest of my life.
After reading the assignment, I immediately decided that I would divide the application into modules and looking ahead,Iâ€™ll say that I didnâ€™t regret this.

Modules allowed large parts of the code to be reused and allowed features to work independently of others.
There is a big amount of different features for example users have the ability to change the theme, levels, turn thesound on and off, and set their own settings, such as the number of bombs.
Creating the game logic wasnâ€™t difficult, most of the development time was spent on adding features with settings andthe ability to load a saved game.

During development I faced different problemsâ€¦Heey Where are bombs?...oh
but finally I sorted out all of it. And when you remove the last mistake and everething in your project is done and you project is workedâ€¦ at this moment you feel like the happiest person in the world.
But, but â€¦ not for long
not much later you learn something new and going into your last project and  every time I look at the code, and understand that I no longer like it and now I can do better I guess itâ€™s normal and is a natural part of learning.

Nowdays I am studying around the clock and everytime I am trying to learn something new.
I believe that everything will work out for me and soon I will be able to say that I am developer, frontend developer ðŸ˜‰
